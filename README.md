The Software to be developed will be called Puzzliverse, it will allow you to play in three different levels of difficulty by assembling a puzzle only with horizontal and vertical movements that are around the blank space, this game will execute procedures such as:

• Play in three difficult levels. • Measure game time per game. • Use the images of the week from www.eso.org to play. • Choose more images to play. • Show image information.

In the first place, puzzliverse thought to develop with the ionic framework, but for lack of information it was decided to develop with unity
